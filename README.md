## Introuction

The problem we are trying ot solve is the unpredictability of sports betting on soccer games. We aim to solve this problem by leveraging ML to create a model that predicts the outcome of soccer matches. Our ultimate goal is that this model will serve as a useful tool for sports betting on soccer.

### Literature Review
The application of machine learning (ML) in sports analytics, particularly in soccer, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Various studies have explored predictive modeling techniques to forecast match outcomes, leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms. One paper utilized logistic regression models to analyze team performance metrics, revealing that specific statistics, such as possession and shots on target, are strong predictors of match results. Another proposed a hybrid model combining ensemble learning and neural networks to improve the prediction of soccer match outcomes. Despite these advancements, many models still struggle with the inherent unpredictability of sports events, which can be influenced by unpredictable factors like referee decisions, player behavior, and real-time game dynamics.

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains historical data of soccer matches. Each row represents a unique match with various features describing the teams' performance prematch, betting odds, and more. Each row is also labeled as a HomeWin, Draw, or AwayWin.
